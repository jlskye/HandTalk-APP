# HandTalk-APP
**A fantastic app which is used to teach people to build eaf-and-dumb signs**

#### * The software uses a vivid 3D character to perform sign-language teaching.
#### * Users can query and learn relevant sign language by selecting chapters and inputing text.
#### * Software will consolidate sign language learning by customizing sign language tests.
#### * The user can interact with the 3D character with a lot of fun.
